# Color Configuration for iOS App

## Description

This configuration file defines custom color values for an iOS application, supporting both light and dark modes. The colors are specified using the sRGB color space, which is the standard color space for most displays and digital media. The colors are represented by their red, green, blue (RGB), and alpha (transparency) components.

The colors are intended to be used across different UI elements of the application to maintain visual consistency and enhance the user experience in both light and dark environments.

## Color Definitions

- **Light Mode Color:** A vibrant, energetic purple (`#C7319B`), used when the app is in light mode.
- **Dark Mode Color:** A slightly muted variant of the purple (`#AF2C88`), used when the app is in dark mode. This color is designed to be easier on the eyes in low-light conditions.

## JSON Structure

### Key Sections

- **`colors`:** An array that holds the color definitions for different appearances (light and dark modes).
  - **`color`:** Specifies the color properties.
    - **`color-space`:** Defines the color space used, in this case, `srgb`.
    - **`components`:** Defines the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) components of the color.
    - **`idiom`:** Specifies that the color is universal, meaning it applies to all device types.
- **`appearances`:** Defines the appearance (e.g., dark mode) where the color should be applied.
  - **`appearance`:** Specifies the type of appearance, such as luminosity (light or dark mode).
  - **`value`:** The specific value for the appearance, such as `dark` for dark mode.
- **`info`:** Metadata about the file.
  - **`author`:** The creator of the file, typically `xcode`.
  - **`version`:** The version of the file format, in this case, `1`.

### Example Structure

```json
{
  "colors": [
    {
      "color": {
        "color-space": "srgb",
        "components": {
          "alpha": "1.000",
          "blue": "0.608",
          "green": "0.196",
          "red": "0.780"
        }
      },
      "idiom": "universal"
    },
    {
      "appearances": [
        {
          "appearance": "luminosity",
          "value": "dark"
        }
      ],
      "color": {
        "color-space": "srgb",
        "components": {
          "alpha": "1.000",
          "blue": "0.529",
          "green": "0.176",
          "red": "0.686"
        }
      },
      "idiom": "universal"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "author": "xcode",
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

## Usage

This JSON configuration is typically included in the asset catalog (`.xcassets`) of an iOS project. The colors defined here can be referenced in the app's UI components through Interface Builder or programmatically in Swift or Objective-C code.

### Example in Swift:

```swift
let myColor = UIColor(named: "MyCustomColor")
```

By referencing these colors in your UI elements, you ensure that your app automatically adapts to the system's light and dark modes, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience for your users.

## Contributing

If you wish to modify or enhance the color scheme, you can edit the RGBA values in the JSON file. Make sure to test the colors in both light and dark modes to ensure that they provide a good user experience across different lighting conditions.
